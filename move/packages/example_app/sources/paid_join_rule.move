/// Module: paid_join_rule
///
/// Example third-party contract demonstrating payment-gated group membership
/// using the `object_*` actor pattern with accumulated funds management.
///
/// ## Pattern Overview
///
/// This pattern enables self-service group joining with payment:
/// 1. Group admin creates a `PaidJoinRule` actor with fee configuration
/// 2. Admin grants the actor's address `ExtensionPermissionsAdmin` permission
/// 3. Users call `join()` to self-serve join by paying the fee
/// 4. Fees accumulate in the rule's `Balance<Token>`
/// 5. Members with `FundsManager` permission can withdraw accumulated funds
///
/// The actor object's UID is passed to `object_grant_permission`, which checks that
/// the actor has `ExtensionPermissionsAdmin` permission before granting `MessagingReader`
/// to the transaction sender (making them a member).
///
/// ## Permissions
///
/// - `FundsManager`: Permission to withdraw accumulated fees from the rule
///
/// ## Usage Flow
///
/// ```move
/// // 1. Admin creates the group
/// let (mut group, encryption_history) = messaging::messaging::create_group(...);
///
/// // 2. Admin creates the paid join rule (generic over token type)
/// let rule = paid_join_rule::new<SUI>(group_id, 1_000_000_000, ctx); // 1 SUI fee
/// let rule_address = object::id(&rule).to_address();
///
/// // 3. Admin grants ExtensionPermissionsAdmin to the rule so it can add members
/// group.grant_permission<Messaging, ExtensionPermissionsAdmin>(rule_address, ctx);
///
/// // 4. Admin grants FundsManager permission to themselves or a treasurer
/// group.grant_permission<Messaging, FundsManager>(treasurer, ctx);
///
/// // 5. Share the rule so users can access it
/// transfer::share_object(rule);
///
/// // 6. User self-serves to join (gets MessagingReader permission)
/// paid_join_rule::join<SUI>(&mut rule, &mut group, &mut payment, ctx);
///
/// // 7. Treasurer withdraws accumulated funds
/// let funds = paid_join_rule::withdraw<SUI>(&mut rule, &group, amount, ctx);
/// ```
